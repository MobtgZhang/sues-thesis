\end{center}

This template is a \LaTeX{} template written for the graduate design thesis of Shanghai University of Engineering Technology. It aims to let everyone focus on the content of the thesis without spending too much energy on the customization and adjustment of the format. This manual is the corresponding Reference, which provides some environments and commands to make the use of templates more convenient. At the same time, it should be noted that users need to have some experience in using \LaTeX{}, 
and at least use some functions of the ctex package, such as adjusting Kerning or modifying font size, etc.

For details on the updated address of the latex template of Shanghai University of Engineering and Technology Master's Graduation Design Thesis, please refer to \href{https://github.com/MobtgZhang/SUES-thsis}{GitHub}.
